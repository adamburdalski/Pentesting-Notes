### **Introduction**

{: .intro}

> * Injection vulnerabilities are considered the number 3 risk in OWASP's Top 10 Web App Risks, given their high impact and how common they are.
> * Injection occurs when user-controlled input is misinterpreted as part of the web query or code being executed, which may lead to subverting the intended outcome of the query to a different outcome that is useful to the attacker.
> * When it comes to OS Command Injections, the user input we control must directly or indirectly go into (or somehow affect) a web query that executes system commands.

### **Injection Operators**

| Injection Operator | Injection Character | URL-Encoded Character | Executed Command                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Semicolon          | ;                   | %3b                   | Both                                       |
