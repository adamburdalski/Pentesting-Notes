# NFS

## **Introduction**

> * Network File System (NFS) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB.
> * Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. However, it uses an entirely different protocol.
> * NFS' default port is 2049 TCP

***

## **Basic Enumeration & Interaction**

> * When footprinting NFS, the TCP ports 111 and 2049 are essential.
> * We can also get information about the NFS service and the host via RPC (2049)
